This is the second project worked on by "die wahren zweities".
The members of this group are Gunta, Jasmin und Mattis.

We are woking on a small game that is similar to GEOGUESSER as part of the GIS course at the HFU.

Remarks and open issues by UH 2024-01-04:
- It is really fun to play, but a little bit too simple.
- Read and obey the code comments in order to improve the code quality.
- Clean the unneccessary files and code snippets:
  - ${url} for example and script.js - done
- Change the "Punktestand l√∂schen." button so that it fits the look&feel of the game. Allow players to save their results and enter a name when e.g. 10 cities are played.
- Add a timer, so that there is some pressure to answer in time. - done
- Include several levels of difficulties by changing the map size (your mapSizeInGPS variable) or the popularity of cities (use different lists) or an offset of the map position (so that not always the city center is shown) done. 
- Display a leaderboard
